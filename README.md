## Username Classification Model 👤🔍

This is a machine learning model that can classify usernames into two categories: spam and non-spam. The model is based on a deep learning architecture that uses a combination of embedding layers, LSTM layers, and fully connected layers. The input to the model is a string representing a username, and the output is a probability distribution over the two categories.

## Dataset 📊

The model was trained on a dataset of usernames that were manually labeled as spam or non-spam. The dataset contains approximately 50,000 usernames, with a roughly equal number of examples in each category.

## Performance 🏆

The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set, and has been shown to generalize well to new data. However, as with any machine learning model, its performance may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the data.
